Building block "clients" is here for compatibility reasons to support 
existing tools and management applications.

For the development of new management applications please refer to the 
API provided by the "core routes" labeled with "v2", e.g. "oauth2_v2".

Clients/API-Keys should IMO be decoupled from concrete authorization 
mechanisms.
